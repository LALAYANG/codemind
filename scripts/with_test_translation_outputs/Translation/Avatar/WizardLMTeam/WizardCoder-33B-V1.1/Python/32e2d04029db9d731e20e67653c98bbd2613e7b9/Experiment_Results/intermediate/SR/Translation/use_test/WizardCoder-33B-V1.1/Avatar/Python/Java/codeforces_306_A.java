<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Translate the following Python code to Java and enclose your solution inside ```java and ```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
81 27

Expected output:
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 

```
n , m = map ( int , input ( ).split ( ) )
q = n // m
r = n % m
a = [ q ] * m
for i in range ( r ) :
    a [ i ] += 1
for i in range ( m ) :
    print ( a [ i ] , end = ' ' )


```

### Response:
Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = scanner.nextInt();
        int q = n / m;
        int r = n % m;
        int[] a = new int[m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            a[i] = q;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            a[i]++;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            System.out.print(a[i] + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads two integers from the standard input, performs some calculations, and then prints the result.

Please note that in Java, you need to import the `java.util.Scanner` class to read input from the standard input. Also, the `print` function in Java does not have an `end` parameter like in Python. Instead, you can use `print` or `println` to print with or without a newline, respectively. <｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
