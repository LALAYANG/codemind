<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Translate the following Python code to Java and enclose your solution inside ```java and ```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
3 3
10 9 12

Expected output:
2


```
n , d = map ( int , input ( ).split ( ) )
x = [ ]
m = 0
q = 0
x = input ( ).split ( )
for i in range ( len ( x ) ) :
    x [ i ] = int ( x [ i ] )
for a in range ( len ( x ) - 1 ) :
    if x [ a ] >= x [ a + 1 ] :
        q = int ( ( x [ a ] - x [ a + 1 ] ) / d + 1 )
        m = m + q
        x [ a + 1 ] = x [ a + 1 ] + q * d
print ( m )


```

### Response:
Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] x = new int[n];
        int m = 0;
        int q = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            x[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        for (int a = 0; a < n - 1; a++) {
            if (x[a] >= x[a + 1]) {
                q = (x[a] - x[a + 1]) / d + 1;
                m += q;
                x[a + 1] += q * d;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(m);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads the number of elements `n` and the difference `d`, then reads `n` integers into an array `x`. It then iterates over the array, and for each pair of adjacent elements, if the first element is greater than or equal to the second, it calculates the number of increments needed to make the difference between them equal to `d`, increments `m` by this amount, and increments the second element by this amount times `d`. Finally, it prints the total number of increments `m`. <｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
