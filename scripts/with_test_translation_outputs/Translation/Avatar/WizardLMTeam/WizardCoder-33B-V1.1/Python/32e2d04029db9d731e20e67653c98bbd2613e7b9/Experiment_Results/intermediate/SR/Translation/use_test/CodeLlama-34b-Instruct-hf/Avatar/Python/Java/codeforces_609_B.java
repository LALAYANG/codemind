Explanation:

The code above is a Java implementation of the Python code you provided. It uses a similar approach to count the number of unique elements in the input list and then calculates the result based on that count.

The `main` method first reads the input from the user using a `Scanner` object. It then creates two arrays, `lst` and `l`, to store the input list and the count of each element in the list, respectively.

The code then iterates over the input list and updates the count of each element in the `l` array. If an element is already present in the `l` array, its count is incremented, otherwise, its count is set to 1.

After updating the count of each element, the code iterates over the input list again and calculates the result based on the count of each element. If an element has a count greater than 1, the result is incremented by the difference between the current index and the index of the first occurrence of the element, minus the count of the element. If an element has a count of 1, the result is incremented by the difference between the current index and the index of the element.

Finally, the code prints the result to the console.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input list is sorted in ascending order. If the input list is not sorted, the result may be incorrect.</s>
