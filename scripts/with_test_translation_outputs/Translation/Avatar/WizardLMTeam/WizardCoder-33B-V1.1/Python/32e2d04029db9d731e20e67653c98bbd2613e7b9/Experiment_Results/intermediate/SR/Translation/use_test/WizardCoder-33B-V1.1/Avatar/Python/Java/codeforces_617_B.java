<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Translate the following Python code to Java and enclose your solution inside ```java and ```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
100
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Expected output:
0


```
from math import prod
input ( )
a = input ( )
print ( 0 if a.count ( "1" ) == 0 else prod ( [ i.count ( "0" ) + 1 for i in a.strip ( "0 " ).split ( '1' ) ] ) )


```

### Response:
Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.nextLine(); // consume the newline after the number
        String a = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println(process(a));
    }

    public static int process(String a) {
        if (!a.contains("1")) {
            return 0;
        }

        String[] parts = a.split("1");
        int product = 1;
        for (String part : parts) {
            int count = part.length() + 1;
            product *= count;
        }
        return product;
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads the input, and then calls the `process` method, which does the same thing as your Python code. The `process` method splits the input string on "1", counts the number of "0"s in each part, adds 1 to that count (because the parts are separated by "1"), and multiplies all these counts together. If there are no "1"s in the input string, it returns 0. <｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
