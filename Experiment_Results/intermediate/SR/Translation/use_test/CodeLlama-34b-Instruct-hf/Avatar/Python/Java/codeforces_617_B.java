Translate the following Python code to Java and enclose your solution inside ```java and ```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
100
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Expected output:
0


```
from math import prod
input ( )
a = input ( )
print ( 0 if a.count ( "1" ) == 0 else prod ( [ i.count ( "0" ) + 1 for i in a.strip ( "0 " ).split ( '1' ) ] ) )


```

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {
            if (input.charAt(i) == '1') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        if (count == 0) {
            System.out.println(0);
        } else {
            int product = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                product *= (input.charAt(i) - '0') + 1;
            }
            System.out.println(product);
        }
    }
}
```
Note: The above code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user. The `Scanner` class is a simple way to read input from the user, but it is not the most efficient way to do so. In a real-world application, you may want to use a more efficient input method, such as reading from a file or using a library that provides a more efficient input method.</s>
